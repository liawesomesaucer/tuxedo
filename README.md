# Tuxedo

Turn your screen to black and white on certain websites. Currently not configurable which sites, but that will come sometime

## Current support

Supports chrome versions â‰¥ 76

I built this for myself to use so currently it only works on facebook, reddit, and youtube, and is pretty fast for me to set that way.

The intention of this application to provide (1) minor annoyance/friction and (2) constant reminding that you are using up precious time by being annoyingly bland. If you're actually trying to fully block websites, try editing your `/etc/hosts` (if on mac) or try something that can't be as easily removed as a chrome extension.

## Product roadmap

* Splash page
* Artdeco font

## Why don't you just set the entire screen to black, Vincent?

I want my syntax highlighting. My phone runs black and white most of the time. You can trust modern accessibility standards and efforts to put an overwhelming majority of content in a good place :)
