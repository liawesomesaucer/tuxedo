## Current support

Supports chrome versions â‰¥ 76

I built this for myself to add minor annoyance to sites I deem distracting.

The intention of this application to provide (1) minor annoyance/friction and (2) constant reminding that you are using up precious time by being annoyingly bland. If you're actually trying to fully block websites, try editing your `/etc/hosts` (if on mac) or try something that can't be as easily removed as a chrome extension.

Yes, Tuxedo makes it easy to remove sites after they are added.

## Product roadmap

* Splash page
* Artdeco font
* Make sites unblockable for a certain period of "focus" time
